# APCSA Freedom Project
by Elizabeth Vazquez

## Context
In the High School of Telecommunication Arts and Technologies, many students from each
grade can be accepted into the Software Engineering Program (SEP) class. For the 2019-2020
school year, seniors who are planning to pursue Computer Science in college or want to learn
more coding are now given the opportunity to take Advanced Placement Computer Science A
(APCSA). As a part of SEP, students are to work on a year-long project where we:
* define & research a problem;
* brainstorm & plan solutions; and
* create, test, revise,& share our software product.

This project enables students to think outside the box, work on something they're passionate
about, be better problem-solvers, be independent, learn on our own, and develop skills that
will inevitably be useful in any field we choose to go into - Computer Science or not.
Technology is innovative and a cycle of problems, work, and solutions to make creators and
users alike informed, entertained, and bustling with curiosity.
