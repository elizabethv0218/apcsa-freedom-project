# Entry 2
##### 11/15/19

For the last four weeks, my partners and I have been tinkering with different sources to determine which tool we would use for the rest of the year. In my last blog entry, I knew that we would have to use [**Java**](https://www.w3schools.com/java/java_intro.asp) to create our app, so it was just a matter of finding online resources that would help us accomplish that. In fact, Nadia Ousman, Aaliyah Sealey, and I were 95% certain that we would stick with Java as our tool for the Freedom Project.

For the first week of tinkering, Nadia and I had to make executive decisions on what steps would have to be taken from each of us before even beginning to dive into making the project. We reminded ourselves that our long-term goal was to create an android app that would remind users to take their prescriptions. It's safe to say that we had begun the **research** portion of the engineering design process. Initially, we began conducting some **problem decomposition** by thinking about the major things that we would need for our app. We asked ourselves:
* How are we going to make an app?
* What online resources may we have to download?
* Are there any programming languages other than Java that we'll have to learn?
* Should we allow users to login to save their progress? (Yes.)

Nadia and I set on to find answers by learning **how to Google** to find additional sources. We came across [**Android Studio**](https://developer.android.com/studio/install) and settled on using it to make our application after asking our teacher, Mr. Mueller, for permission to download it onto the lab's computer.

During the second week of tinkering, Nadia and I gave Aaliyah a recap of what we did while she was gone and we agreed that she would research more about [**Firebase**](https://firebase.google.com/) and how to have it work with Java. Aaliyah investigated more about Firebase by looking at [**Beginner's Guides**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9kRgVxULbag) and [**login information**](https://firebase.google.com/docs/auth/web/password-auth). Meanwhile Nadia and I were being introduced to [**Android Studio's IDE**](https://blog.mindorks.com/introduction-to-android-studio-ide).

What we were doing on the third week of tinkering was finding ways to connect [**Github**](https://github.com/) to Android Studio, so we could all work on the workplace instead of being limited to working on the project during our class period. This is still a pending issue that we were trying to resolve during the fourth week. Nadia and I were a bit overwhelmed by Android Studio's IDE because of its numerous tabs and functions, but we are learning on our own by testing the studio and looking at videos like [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EOfCEhWq8sg) one. All in all, we've practiced our **collaboration**, **communication**, and **learning** skills again.

Our AP Computer Science A class has been teaching us many of Java's code like variables, if statements, for loops, arrays, methods, etc. and real world applications of them. The lessons are really a testament to how endless the posibilities are with this programming language. It goes without saying that we'll have to continue researching outside of the classroom if we wish to complete our app by the end of the year, but we're all looking forward to it.
