# Entry 1
##### 10/18/20

Today is a Friday, or as our class likes to call it **Freedom Friday**. Freedom Friday is the
one day of the week where we focus on the development of our **Freedom Project**: a year-long
project where we identify a problem and create a software project with a programming language,
or languages, of our choice. During the other days of the week, we are learning Java as a part of
our APCSA curriculum.

Before this week's Friday, we've been researching the variety of tools that we could use to
make our projects via [Google](https://www.google.com/). Some of the tools that have caught my
attention are [**EarSketch**](https://earsketch.gatech.edu/landing/#/) (a tool with a library
of sounds), [**Firebase**](https://firebase.google.com/) (from Google and helps build apps),
and [**Java**](https://www.w3schools.com/java/java_intro.asp) (allows creators to make apps).
Before we had begun investigating, I knew that I wanted to make an Android app because it holds
around 50% of the smartphone operating systems' market. Additionally, I feel like anyone who is
going to major in Computer Science, like myself, will have to learn how to make an application
sooner or later.

This afternoon, we were asked by our APCSA teacher, Mr. Mueller, to make a circle in the
computer lab and share what tool we were thinking of using and what we would make of it. As I've
previously mentioned, I knew I wanted to make an Android app, but I was still lost on what the
app would be about. I was torn upon what problem I could improve and the audience I wanted my
project to cater to. The purpose of the Freedom Project reminded me of another year-long project
I'm working on where we define a quality of life issue, research it, and recommend a solution.
That's why when my turn came, I said I was thinking about an app to teach students about financing
or an app that would help undocumented immigrants.

Admittedly, those ideas were short-lived when I heard one of my classmates, Nadia Ousman, say
that she would like to make _an app to help users be reminded of when to take their prescriptions_.
Immediately, I started to think about the different functions that could be implemented into
the app like alarms, descriptions of the prescriptions, when to get refills, logging in, etc.
I thought her idea was fantastic because I have asthma and a skin routine, but I haven't been
as diligent about when I take my medicine and use my products which would be a graver problem
if my conditions were severe. It was a relief to hear that we were allowed to talk amongst
ourselves after the activity, so I didn't waste the chance to talk to her about working
together. Another classmate, Aaliyah Sealey, was interested, so we agreed to be a trio. Even
after class, we discussed potential ideas and research we could think about in the school
library and how that issue was affecting our own lives. Based on that alone, I'd say I'm
practicing my **communication** and **collaboration** skills.

Our next step will be to research this problem. The questions I'll keep in mind are:
* How responsibly do people deal with their prescriptions?
* Are there any other Android apps that have addressed this problem?
* What are their critiques/user reviews?
